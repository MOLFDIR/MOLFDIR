  ATOMIC ORBITALS   (AOs)      Cartesian gaussians of the form

                               where the AO normalization factor, N, is
                               such that the integrals are normalized to
 
                               (2l-1)!!(2m-1)!!(2n-1)!!
 
                               and where !! denotes the odd number factorial.
                               This leads to the same normalization factor, N,
                               for all AOs with the same principal quantum
                               number.

                               If some of the AOs in a set are not desired,
                               they can be eliminated by omitting appropriate
                               symmetry orbitals.
 
  SYMMETRY ORBITALS (SOs)      Linear combinations of AOs that transform
                               according to an irreducible representation.  The
                               current version of the program can only handle
                               D2h and its subgroups.
 
  NUCLEAR INTERCHANGE GROUP    Group that describes how the nuclei are
                               transformed by symmetry operators.  This will
                               always be the same as, or a subgroup of, the
                               point group of the molecule.  For example, for
                               H2O the group is of order 2 and can be
                               considered to be either Cs or C2.  For C2H4 the
                               group is of order 4, while for F2 the group is
                               of order 2.  The group will be the same as the
                               point group when there are no operators, other
                               than the identity, whose effect on the nuclei is
                               the same as that of the identity.
 
  AO REDUCTION SETS            The irreducible representations that make up the
                               representation formed by a given set of
                               symmetry-related AOs.  For CH2 with a
                               (s,p,d/s,p) basis there are five AO reduction
                               sets:
 
                                  C(s)  -  A1
                                  C(p)  -  A1+B1+B2
                                  C(d)  -  A1+A1+A1+A2+B1+B2
                                  H(s)  -  A1+B2
                                  H(p)  -  A1+A1+A2+B1+B2+B2
 
  SO TRANSFORMATION MATRICES   Transformation matrices that express the SOs in
                               terms of a set of AOs.  Each SO transformation
                               matrix is indexed in data set 9 to an AO
                               reduction set which defines the symmetries of
                               the components.
 
  STANDARD SYMMETRY TABLE      ARGOS requires that the first symmetry block be
                               that of the totally symmetric irreducible
                               representation, but the other symmetry blocks
                               can be in any order (the symmetry multiplication
                               table is specified by the user in data sets 4
                               and 5).  The transformation, MCSCF, and CI
                               programs require that the symmetry blocks be
                               ordered in a manner consistent with a standard
                               multiplication table:

                               where the suggested transformation properties of
                               the cartesian coordinates and of the components
                               of angular momentum are indicated as well.
                               These imply the orientation of the coordinate
                               axes with respect to the symmetry elements.
                               CIDBG, the spin-orbit CI program, requires the
                               above angular momentum transformation
                               properties.  For future reference, the above
                               multiplication table is isomorphic to the 
                               binary exclusive-or table of the numbers 0 to 7.

          ITOL                AO integrals with overlap exponential factors
                              less than 10**(-ITOL) will be omitted.  The
                              default is 20.
 
          ICUT                Both AO and SO integrals with values less than
                              10**(-ICUT) will be omitted.  The default is 9.
 
          AOINTS              Unit number for output integral file.  The
                              default is 4, the default name is 'aoints'.
 
          ONLY1E              0 to compute both 1-e and 2-e integrals.
                              1 to compute only 1-e integrals (note, FSPLIT=2
                              is also required in this case. see below.) This
                              is used for cases in which a set of 2-e integrals
                              is associated with several sets of 1-e integrals.
                              Examples include external fields, the use of
                              point charges to simulate a changing environment,
                              and the computation of basis set superposition
                              errors.  The default is 0.
 
          INRM                Set to 1 for symmetry orbitals normalized with
                              respect to one-center integrals.
 
          NCRS                Number of distinct sets of expansions for core
                              and spin-orbit potentials

          L1REC               Maximum record length to use for the 1-e 
                              integral records.  The default value is -1
                              which invokes the SIFS value.  A value of 0
                              invokes the ARGOS default value of 4096.

          L2REC               Maximum record length to use for the 2-e
                              integral records.  The default value is -1.
                              A value of 0 invokes the ARGOS default.
 
          AOINT2              Unit number for the 2-e integral file.  Accessed
                              only if ONLY1E=0 and FSPLIT=2.  The default unit
                              is 8, the default filename is 'aoints2'.

          FSPLIT              File split parameter. FSPLIT=1 forces both
                              1-e and 2-e integrals to be written to the same
                              file, AOINTS.  FSPLIT=2 causes the 2-e integrals
                              to be written to the separate AOINT2 file.  The
                              default value is 2.

                              irreducible representation.  It is 0 for C1, C2,
                              Cs, Ci; 1 for C2v, D2, C2h; 7 for D2h.
                              If NDPT<0, then P1,P2,P3 values consistent with 
                              the standard 8x8 multiplication table are 
                              generated internally.
 
 
   5)     P1(I),P2(I),P3(I)   Numbers corresponding to irreducible
                              representations as defined in data set 3 such
                              that P1 X P2 = P3.  For C2v, D2, and C2h, these
                              must be 2 3 4 (in any order).  See example 1 for
                              D2h.

                              this set.  The input values have the sign of the
                              desired SO coefficient but the magnitude is equal
                              to the square of the coefficient.  This allows
                              the coefficients for almost all point groups to
                              be expressed in integer form.
 
 
   8)     ICONU(I)            Number of primitives in the Ith contraction set

                              V(p)-V(l=LCRU),... for core; V(p), V(d), ...,

                                         2 1
                              It is always assumed the starting order is

 ******************************************************************************
 
 
    REDIMENSIONING:
 
                All dimensions are set in ARGOS and SEG1MN, as explained by
           comment cards there.  The following are the quantities involved:
 
    MSUP   Maximum number of symmetry-inequivalent types of atoms
    MSTUP  Maximum number of irreducible representations
    MRCRUP Maximum number of contractions in a contraction set
    MCONUP Maximum number of primitives in a contraction set
    MCUP   Maximum number of symmetry-equivalent atoms
    KAORDP Maximum number of AO reduction sets
    MCONSP Maximum number of contraction sets
    MGCSUP Maximum number of SO transformation sets
    MRUP   Maximum number of irreducible representations in an AO reduction set
    MCSUP  Maximum number of SOs in a transformation matrix
    MCTUP  Maximum number of AOs in a transformation matrix
    MCRUP  Maximum number of expansion functions for potentials
    MSFUP  Maximum number of function sets
    MGUP   Maximum number of operators in the nuclear interchange group
    MSFRUP Maximum number of SOs
    MNRUP  Maximum number of charge distributions from a pair of function sets
    MCCUP  Maximum number of symmetry-unique center combinations for 4 types
                of atoms
    MBLUP  Maximum amount of work space for SO matrices, products of SO
                coefficients, and integral arrays
 
                Messages are printed if dimensions are exceeded; most are set
           to fairly high values and only rarely need to be changed.  If a
           message is printed, look for PARAMETER statement(s) in ARGOS and
           SEG1MN containing the variable name printed.
 
    SEGMENTING (overlaying):
 
                The program can be run in a simple segmented form (one-electron
           code, then two-electron code):
 
       Cray(ctss) SEGMENTING:
          mo=full,ml=tstmap,x=xargos
          bin=(oargos1,oargos2,oargos3,oargos4,oargos5,oargos6)
          tree
          root(one,two)
          endtree
          segment root
          modules=(main,argos,rt123,root4,root5)
          segment one
          modules=seg1mn
          segment two
          modules=twoint
          endseg
 
       FPS APLINK4 overlaying:
          ARGOS;
          (OV1:SEG1MN;
          OV2:TWOINT;)

 VMS: On VAX VMS computers, all filenames are translated using the standard
 logical name tables.  If ARGOS is defined as a foreign command with the
 VMS DCL statement "DEFINE ARGOS:==$DEVICE:[DIRECTORY]ARGOS.EXE" (the $ is
 important), then the workspace memory may be set from the command line. For
 example,

       $ ASSIGN MY_DEVICE:[MY.DIRECTORY]MY_AOINTS.DAT     AOINTS
       $ ARGOS /M=50000

 would cause argos to use the indicated device and filename instead of the
 default []AOINTS.DAT file in the default directory.  Argos would only use
 50000 REAL*8 words of workspace, allocated from a blank common pool, instead
 of the usual default value.  The maximum allowable value is determined by
 the dimensioned size of the blank common pool.

 Unix: On unix computers, all filenames are translated using the process
 environment variables.  Upper-case variables only are valid matches.
 Workspace size may be set from the command line using "-M nnnnnn".  Both upper
 and lower case "M" are valid.  For example, from the Bourne shell:

      $ AOINTS=my/directory/my_aoints  $COLUMBUS/argos.x -m 50000

 or
      $ AOINTS=my/directory/my_aoints
      $ export AOINTS
      $ $COLUMBUS/argos.x -m 50000

 or from the C shell:

      % setenv AOINTS my/directory/my_aoints
      % $COLUMBUS/argos.x -m 50000 

 causes the integral file to be redirected and the workspace size to be
 set as indicated.  On unix machines, there is no upper limit on the
 workspace allocated imposed by argos; invalid requests result in a nonzero
 return status.

PARALLEL EXECUTION: On unix machines, ARGOS may be prepared to run in
a parallel message-passing environment.  In this mode of execution,
the output filenames, argosls, aoints, and aoints2 are all appended
with a 3-digit parallel process number (e.g. argosls_000, argosls_001,
etc.).  FSPLIT=2 is required in this mode.  A simple deterministic
distribution of the workload is used to distribute the effort across
several CPUs or across a heterogeneous network of machines.  The
TCGMSG library and documentation should be consulted for details.  The
TCGMSG library may be obtained using anonymous FTP from
ftp.tcg.anl.gov.  See the directory $COLUMBUS/source/p_argos for more
information and for sample test cases.

 ******************************************************************************
 
      ARGOS was written at Argonne National Laboratory and Ohio State
 University in 1982 and 1983 with help from R. L. Shepard.  It was based on
 I94720, a corresponding program for segmented contractions, which was written
 in 1979 at the National Resource for Computation in Chemistry with support
 from the H. F. Schaefer group at the University of California, Berkeley.
 I94720, in turn, was based on SAINT (I43210).  Core-potential and spin-orbit
 integrals were added to ARGOS in 1983 and 1984 at Lawrence Livermore National
 Laboratory with help from N. W. Winter.
 
      Support has been provided by the above institutions, the Department of
 Energy, the National Science Foundation, and Cray Research, Inc.
 
      Some subroutines for primitive AO integral evaluation were provided from
 the HONDO and MELDPS systems (see REFERENCES) and have been modified to
 varying degrees.
 
      Distribution of this program is handled primarily through Argonne
 National Laboratory as part of the COLUMBUS system of programs.  Contact

 EXAMPLE 2.  This example is for methylene with C2v symmetry.  One irrep
 product is required.  Because methylene is planar, there is only one nuclear
 interchange generator.  The 3s combination of cartesian d orbitals is
 included.  An effective core potential and a spin-orbit operator for the
 carbon atom are used.
