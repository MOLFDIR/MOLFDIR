C     CALCULATE TWO-ELECTRON INTEGRALS FOR MOLECULAR DIRAC-HARTREE-FOCK
C     SCF WITH SEPERATE LARGE AND SMALL COMPONENT BASISSETS. INTEGRALS
C     ARE OVER CARTHESIAN GAUSSIANS AND SYMMETRY OPERATIONS ARE USED TO
C     DETERMINE WETHER INTEGRALS ARE UNIQUE OR NOT. ONLY UNIQUE INTEGRALS
C     ARE STORED IF THEIR VALUE IS ABOVE SOME THRESHOLD, TOGETHER WITH A
C     LABEL.
